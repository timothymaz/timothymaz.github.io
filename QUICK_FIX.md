# 🚨 Quick Fix - Site is Blank

## ✅ I Just Deployed Your Site!

Your React portfolio has been built and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 🔧 One Last Step (Takes 30 seconds)

**You need to tell GitHub to use the gh-pages branch:**

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to your GitHub repo settings:**

   👉 https://github.com/timothymaz/timothymaz.github.io/settings/pages

2. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - Change **Source** from "GitHub Actions" to **"Deploy from a branch"**
   - Set **Branch** to **`gh-pages`**
   - Set folder to **`/ (root)`**
   - Click **Save**

3. **Wait 1-2 minutes**, then visit:

   👉 https://timothymazur.com

4. **Hard refresh** your browser:
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

## 🎉 That's It!

Your new React portfolio will be live!

## 📝 Future Deployments

After you make changes, just run:

```bash
# Windows
deploy-now.bat

# OR push to main (GitHub Actions will deploy automatically)
git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🆘 Still Blank?

1. **Verify GitHub Pages settings** point to `gh-pages` branch
2. **Clear browser cache** completely
3. **Try incognito/private window**
4. **Wait another minute** - GitHub's CDN can be slow

---

**Your portfolio is ready to go live! Just change that one setting in GitHub.** 🚀
