## 🔮 SecurityDemo Component (Placeholder Created)

The SecurityDemo component has been created as a placeholder that shows a "Coming Soon" message and links to the original `/XSSSQL/index.html` demo.

**Future Enhancement Opportunity:**
When you're ready, we can build out the full SecurityDemo with:
- Interactive XSS demonstrations (stored, reflected, DOM-based)
- SQL injection demos with mock database
- Side-by-side vulnerable vs. secure code
- Educational explanations
- Toggle to enable/disable vulnerabilities
- Multiple tabs (XSS, SQL, Best Practices, Resources)

---

## 🎨 Theme Integration

The Terminal adapts to your site's theme:

**Dark Theme (Default):**
- Cyan accent color (#00d4aa)
- Dark background
- White/gray text

**Light Theme:**
- Blue accents (#0099ff)
- Light gray background
- Dark text

**Cyber Theme:**
- Green Matrix-style (#00ff41)
- Pure black background
- Green glow effects

---

## 📊 Performance

- **Bundle Size:** Optimized
- **Animation:** 30fps Matrix rain (smooth!)
- **Load Time:** Fast initial render
- **Memory:** Efficient with proper cleanup
- **Mobile:** Responsive and performant

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements Over Original

1. **React Integration** - No more iframe or external redirects
2. **Theme Aware** - Matches your site's color scheme
3. **Enhanced Commands** - More features and Easter eggs
4. **Better UX** - Mac-style window, smooth animations
5. **Mobile Optimized** - Works great on all devices
6. **Maintainable** - Clean React code vs. vanilla JS
7. **Type Safety** - Better structure and organization

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

### SecurityDemo Expansion:
When ready to build the full SecurityDemo:
1. Create tabbed interface (XSS, SQL, Best Practices)
2. Implement interactive XSS demos with toggle
3. Build mock database for SQL injection examples
4. Add code comparison (vulnerable vs. safe)
5. Include educational "How it Works" sections

### Additional Terminal Commands (Ideas):
- `neofetch` - System info display
- `whoami` - More philosophical response
- `tree` - ASCII file tree
- `ping` - Fake network ping
- `uptime` - Show site uptime
- `fortune` - Random fortune cookie
