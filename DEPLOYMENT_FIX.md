# ✅ Deployment Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

Your React app was building correctly locally but showing a blank page on `timothymazur.com` because:

1. **GitHub Pages Configuration**: For username.github.io sites, GitHub Pages needs the built files in a specific branch
2. **Missing .nojekyll file**: GitHub Pages tries to process files with Jekyll by default, which breaks React apps
3. **Wrong deployment target**: The built React app needs to be in the `gh-pages` branch, not the `main` branch

## What I Fixed

### 1. Created `.nojekyll` File
This tells GitHub Pages NOT to process files with Jekyll, which would break React.

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
Changed from the Pages API to a simpler `gh-pages` branch deployment that works reliably.

### 3. Created Manual Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-now.bat` (Windows)
- `deploy-now.sh` (Mac/Linux)

### 4. Deployed Your Site
I just deployed your React app to the `gh-pages` branch!

---

## ✅ Your Site is Now Deploying!

I've successfully pushed your React portfolio to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Final Step: Update GitHub Pages Settings

**Go to your GitHub repository and set the source:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/timothymaz/timothymaz.github.io/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment"
3. Set **Source** to: `Deploy from a branch`
4. Set **Branch** to: `gh-pages` and folder to `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**

**Your site will be live at https://timothymazur.com in 1-2 minutes!**

## How to Deploy Updates (Going Forward)

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
Just push to main branch and GitHub Actions will handle it:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to `gh-pages` branch.

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

**Windows:**
```bash
deploy-now.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy-now.sh
./deploy-now.sh
```

## Verify Deployment

After 1-2 minutes:

1. Visit: https://timothymazur.com
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. You should see your new React portfolio!

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing blank page after 2 minutes?

1. **Check GitHub Pages settings** (link above)
2. **Hard refresh** your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/timothymaz/timothymaz.github.io/actions
4. **Clear browser cache** completely

### Seeing the old site?

- Clear your browser cache and hard refresh
- GitHub's CDN cache can take a few minutes to update

### CSS not loading?

- This should be fixed with the .nojekyll file
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

## What's in the gh-pages Branch?

The `gh-pages` branch contains ONLY the built/compiled files:

```
gh-pages branch:
├── index.html              # Built React app entry
├── assets/                 # Bundled JS/CSS
├── Terminal/               # Your terminal project
├── XSSSQL/                 # Your XSS demo
├── images/                 # Your images
├── .nojekyll              # Tells GitHub: don't use Jekyll
└── CNAME                   # Custom domain config
```

The `main` branch still has all your source code.

## Branch Structure

```
main branch       → Your React source code + legacy projects
     ↓
  npm run build   → Builds React app to dist/
     ↓
GitHub Actions    → Copies to gh-pages branch
     ↓
gh-pages branch   → Built files that GitHub Pages serves
     ↓
timothymazur.com  → Your live site! 🎉
```

---

## Status

✅ Built successfully
✅ Deployed to gh-pages branch
⏳ Waiting for GitHub Pages to update (1-2 min)
⚠️ **You need to**: Update GitHub Pages settings to use `gh-pages` branch

---

**Once you set the branch in GitHub settings, your site will be live!** 🚀
